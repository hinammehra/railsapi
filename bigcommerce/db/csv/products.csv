These climatic conditions brought late budding and enhanced vigour in the vines. Veraison (change of colour of maturing berries) was also delayed compared with average dates in Ribera del Duero. Summer was very dry with moderate temperatures. As a result, the phenolic maturation (accumulation of colour in the skins) progressed more rapidly that the alcoholic ripening (accumulation of sugar in the pulp). These circumstances forced waiting until mid-October to start harvesting. Fortunately, the weather remained dry and, in spite of a mild frost, the grapes progressed to perfect ripening while retaining a fantastic acidity.Â Fermentation in stainless steel, Worden and concrete tanks.

The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 2 weeks. After the maceration the wine is aged on its lees and the liquid is delicately separated so the skins and seeds can be pressed.

About: These wines are released in a limited series of 42,000 bottles per Artist and they are all complex wines to enjoy and to be paired with complex and subtle meals. As an attempt to blend the world of wine and the world of art, Bodegas Altanza released for the first time in 2001Â a unique wine dedicated to Joan MirÃ_, which obtained 95 points in ""The Wine Advocate"" (Robert Parker). This collection of Spanish Artists tries to unify the creation of a unique wine with the creation of a piece of art. Combining the wine with the painting is quite a complex process but there many parallels: an artist belongs to a school, has a style and marks a time, an epoch; the wine has a Denomination of Origin that is like the school the artist belongs to. The label and the character represents the winery and the philosophy that is applied when making the wine, in the same way as the artist creates his piece of art.

This wine presents an excellent ripeness, power and weight, with structure and developing complexity. The crisp acidity, the fine tannins, and alcohol, together with the fruit, gives this wine good concentration and length. Very well balanced wine. Pair with any high quality meal with intense flavour. It is also perfect with any spicy meal and sauces with almonds, coffee, cocoa, coconuts, etc. Â  Alcohol: 13.5% Volume: 750ml Residual sugars: 1.9 gr/litre Standard Drinks: 8.0 Peak drinking: In the next 6 years (2012-2018) Best Served: 18Â°C Ageing: 18 months in French oak casks.

The wine is then aged for 18 months in French oak casks. About:Â These wines are released in a limited series of 42,000 bottles per Artist and they are all complex wines to enjoy and to be paired with complex and subtle meals.Â  As an attempt to blend the world of wine and the world of art, Bodegas Altanza released for the first time in 2001Â a unique wine dedicated to Joan MirÃ_, which obtained 95 points in ""The Wine Advocate"" (Robert Parker). This collection of Spanish Artists tries to unify the creation of a unique wine with the creation of a piece of art. Combining the wine with the painting is quite a complex process but there many parallels: an artist belongs to a school, has a style and marks a time, an epoch; the wine has a Denomination of Origin that is like the school the artist belongs to. The label and the character represents the winery and the philosophy that is applied when making the wine, in the same way as the artist creates his piece of art.

Winemaking:Â This young wine with six months in oak has been made seeking the highest expression of the grape, taking all possible flavours of the Tempranillo grape and maintaining a sweet and harmonious palate.Â An accurate selection of the grapes is followed by a maceration pre-fermentation for 48 hours at 17Â°C. To reach that temperature they use natural spring water taken directly from their land.Â This pre-maceration is done to preserve the fruit and primary aromas of the grape; it also results in a richer colour in the future wine.Â After this process, the alcoholic fermentation takes place at 24ÂºC. The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 2 weeks. After the maceration the wine is aged on its lees and the liquid is delicately separated so the skins and seeds can be pressed. The wine is then aged for 126months in semi-new (2-years-old) Bordelaise French oak.Â The result, Paco GarcÃ_a Seis, is a wineÂ with great aromatic power and velvety mouthfeel that awakens the senses.

It was aged for 12 months in 100% new French oak, after which 50% of the wine spent an additional 8 months in new oak. A glass-coating opaque purple color, it sports an aromatic array dominated by exotic spices, sandalwood, incense, lavender, black cherry, and blueberry. Dense, rich, and loaded, this beautifully proportioned offering has the structure to evolve for another 3-4 years and will deliver prime drinking through 2024+.Grape Variety: 100% MalbecTasting Notes:A glass-coating opaque purple colour. The nose is highly complex and intense. It is the expression of a Malbec in Valle de Uco, characterised by notes of exotic spices, sandalwood, violets and lavender, fresh and ripe fruits â€“ such as black cherries, plums and blueberries. After the fruits appear, spices and notes from the oak such as vanilla, chocolate, caramel and blonde tobacco are present, denoting the 150% oak ageing in new French oak for 20 months. Also some black liquorice notes appear at the end giving more complexity to the whole. This is a wine of great body, structure and harmony in the mouth. The mouth entry is very fulfilling and some sweetness is shown because of its ripe velvety tannins. Itâ€™s very fleshy and meaty, with fine and present tannins and very well integrated acidity that adds freshness to the wine and makes it very pleasant to drink. The aromas in mouth are very complex and repeat those detected in the nose. It is a completely elegant, balanced wine that is very long lasting in the mouth, remarking a pleasant sensation of harmony and flavourfullness.Vineyard: Altamira, San Carlos â€“ Valle de Uco, MendozaÂ Age of the Vineyard: 70 years old, ungrafted old vinesÂ Time of Harvest: 4th week of April 2009Altitude: 1,100 meters above sea levelHarvest Method: Manually in 18kg boxes and selection of grape clusters in the vineyard. Vineyard production of 4,000 kg/ha.Winemaking:Â Manual selection of grapes on vibrating table. The clusters are destemmed and crushed. Maceration in small tanks and fermentation for 25 to 30 days with selected yeasts at a temperature between 25Â° and 32Â°C. During the maceration, they homogenised the wine with â€œpiegage manuelâ€ù by hand. In some years they do some fermentation in barrels. Racking and decantation in stainless steel tanks. Malolactic fermentation in new French oak barrels.Â The potential aroma of this grape is awesome and while it was ageing, after 12 months in 100% new French oak, they decided to rack half of the wine to new oak again for 8 more months. So it is a wine with 150% new French oak. They maintain an elegant and not oaky style for the wine.Â Blending and posterior bottling.

Vineyard: ViÃ±a Quintay, Casablanca Valley â€“ ChileÂ Age of the Vineyard: 8 years oldTime of Harvest: First week of AprilAltitude: 150 metres above sea level Harvest Method: The grapes were handpicked in 12 kg trays in accordance with physical-chemical and tasting criteria. The full ripening of the fruit is sought to produce a balanced, mature, elegant, but alive wine, representative of Casablanca.Winemaking: The harvest is selected grape by grape in the winery in order to ferment only those in perfect condition. Before entering the tanks, they pass through a cold interchanger to reduce the temperature to approximately 3Â°C and are kept in the press for 7 days in order to macerate the skins with the pulp and extract as much as possible in cold. For this vintage, 5% of the fruit was vinified in complete bunches, seeking to give the wine a little more structure. During the alcoholic fermentation, the temperature is raised to 24Â°-26Â°C for about 15 days. The pump over is traditional and in closed tanks, with tasting being made around twice a day. When the fermentation is finished, all the wine is passed to fine toasted French barrels of different makes so that the malolactic fermentation is carried out naturally. During this process (4 months) stirrings are made to raise the lees and keep them in suspension, seeking to generate intensity and weight in the mouth. The wine was then racked, sulphured and returned to the barrels to age until the final blending 6 months later. Before bottling, the wine is filtered by earth and then a 1 micra porosity card.Winemaker: Vicente Johnson Alcohol: 14 % vol.Volume: 750 mlResidual sugars: 4.43 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 8.3Peak drinking: 2013Best Served: 14Â° CAgeing: 10 months in French oak barrels",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Vina Quintay Q Gran Reserve Pinot Noir 2010,0,0,45.45,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,71,4,2,4,Viña Quintay Q Gran Reserve Pinot Noir 2010,Q Gran Reserve Pinot Noir 2010,Viña Quintay Q Gran Reserve Pinot Noir,Q Gran Reserve Pinot Noir,2010 Q Gran Reserve Pinot Noir,0,0,R,NULL,2010,3,4,3.4,"CHI, Casablanca Valley",6,pID-C066,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,33,1,706,1208

The fact that it is short-cycled means that it is the first red grape they harvest. This is very good in terms of climate, as they have a high rate of harvests with the desired polyphenolic ripeness. The grapes are promptly carried into the winery avoiding the raise of temperature and preventing the beginning of the oxidation process. Once in the winery, after carefully selecting bunches, the harvest is destemmed and soft pressure is applied on the grapes to allow very little juice to drain off the fruit. Then the product is kept refrigerated in the vat in order to delay the alcoholic fermentation and to extract the very best the Pinot Noir grape has to offer from its tender skin. This stage may last up to 5 days after which the alcoholic fermentation at controlled temperature begins. When there is no more sugar to ferment, the separation of the skin from the wine is determined by tasting, which is always around the time when the fermentation ends.

Â Succeeding in making these two varieties agree in one wine is nothing but a challenge. The percentages on the different vintages they produced has always been over 70% Pinot Noir and under 30% Tannat. A higher percentage of Tannat would completely overshadow the Pinot Noir. The vinification of both varieties is done under the very same procedure as the pure Tannat and Pinot Noir: the correct ripeness point of the grape, careful selection of bunches, fermentation at controlled temperature, and a careful determination of maceration times.

It caresses the inside of the mouth very gently, releasing all of its rich aromas.Vineyard:Â EspiellsAge of the Vineyard: 30 years old Â Time of Harvest: AugustAltitude: 200 metres above sea levelHarvest Method: ManualÂ Winemaking: Cold Soak,Â  maceration in the press for 9-12 hours.

Grapes from sloping vineyards facing in various directions were also blended with those from flatter plots with poorer soils.Winemaking:Â  All the fermentations began with a five-day cold maceration at around 15Âº C. Once fermentation had started, this took place smoothly and constantly at controlled temperatures between 20ÂºC and 25ÂºC for an average of 8 days, followed by a post-fermentation maceration lasting 6 days.Winemaker: BenjamÃ_n Romeo Hilera Â Â Â Alcohol: 14,9 %Volume: 750 mlResidual sugars: 5.0 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 8.6Peak drinking: 2013-2030Best Served: 16Âº CAgeing: 18 months",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Contador Tempranillo 2008,0,0,1090.9,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,20,4,2,4,Contador Tempranillo Garnacha 2008,Contador Tempranillo Garnacha 2008,Contador Tempranillo Garnacha,Contador Tempranillo Garnacha,2008 Contador Tempranillo Garnacha,1,0,R,NULL,2008,7,4,7.4,"SPA, Rioja",6,pID-S064,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,37,50,4,210,331

Modern, fruity, with the touch of oak just to give it roundness and volume on the palate. This is a wine designed for all to delight in and enjoy. Accompanies both white and red meats (beef, lamb, sirloin) perfectly, as well as all kinds of pasta, stews and cheeses. Â  Alcohol: 14.1% vol. Volume: 750 ml Residual sugars: 1.6 gr/litre Standard Drinks: 8.3 Peak drinking: 5 years Best Served: 16Â°C Ageing: 12 months in two-year-old 100% bordelaise French oak Â  Vineyard: Las Canteras and El Justillo (own vineyards), La Rioja - Spain Age of the Vineyard: Las Canteras planted in 1986 and El Justillo planted in 1998 Time of Harvest: October 2008 Altitude: 470 metres above sea level Harvest Method: Manual harvest. Winemaking: An accurate selection of the grapes is followed by a maceration pre-fermentation for 48 hours at 17Â°C. To reach that temperature they use natural spring water taken directly from their land.Â This pre-maceration is done to preserve the fruit and primary aromas of the grape; it also results in a richer colour in the future wine.Â After this process, the alcoholic fermentation takes place at 26ÂºC. The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 3 weeks in order to create a wine that is special and unique with a different taste, special amplitude in the mouth, increasing the different levels of aromas and giving the wine consistent body. The wine is then aged for 12 months in two-year-old 100% bordelaise French oak.Â  Winemaker: Juan Bautista Garcia Â ",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Paco Garcia Crianza Tempranillo 2010,0,0,22.32,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,57,4,2,4,Paco García Crianza Tempranillo 2010,Crianza Tempranillo 2010,Paco García Crianza Tempranillo,Crianza Tempranillo,2010 Crianza Tempranillo,1,1,WS,NULL,2010,2,4,2.4,"SPA, Rioja Alta",6,pID-S069,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,39,48,1,564,971

Pressed in small vertical manual press, following the old tradition of Burgundy. It is an open press where they do not try to avoid oxygenation of the juice. In the middle of the pressing they perform the rebechage which consists in opening the press and turning over the clusters, to start pressing again. All this is done with utmost care and low pressures are applied at all times, therefore a meagre yield but high quality juice. The fermentation occurs with the natural occurring yeasts and is a long process due to the low fermentation temperatures. In the case of the Capitel, partial malolactic fermentation is allowed.

Creamy sweetness and spice of oak wraps around but does not overwhelm the fruit. Rich but not at all fat. Dry finesse to the tannins, just a hint of vanilla/chocolate on the finish, which is dry and leaves your mouth feeling clean. You could broach it now but it will benefit from longer in bottle. (JH)Grape Variety: 100% MalbecTasting Notes:Vivacious violet-red colour; very intense and pure. The nose is complex, elegant and very intense. This harvest had higher temperatures and this is shown a combination of ripe plum, cassis and blackberry aromas. It also has some fresh spicy notes that add complexity. Liquorice and violets are also present. Afterwards appears some very integrated notes from its ageing in refined French oak such as vanilla, caramel and smoke. This is a wine of great kindness in the mouth. The mature and soft tannins give it vivacity, but they are nonetheless round. Its acidity gives it freshness, assuring good longevity and potential for bottle ageing. The aromas in the mouth are intense and persistent and express themselves as a long, harmonic, elegant and smooth set.Vineyard: Mayor Drummond, LujÃ¡n de Cuyo â€“ Mendoza, ArgentinaAge of the Vineyard: 80 years old, ungrafted old vinesTime of Harvest: 1stÂ and 2ndÂ week of April 2009Altitude: 960 metres above sea levelHarvest Method: Manually in 18kg boxes and selection of grape clusters in the vineyard.

To reach that temperature they use natural spring water taken directly from their land.Â This pre-maceration is done to preserve the fruit and primary aromas of the grape; it also results in a richer colour in the future wine.Â After this process, the alcoholic fermentation takes place at 24ÂºC. The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 2 weeks. After the maceration the wine is aged on its lees and the liquid is delicately separated so the skins and seeds can be pressed. The wine is then aged for 126months in semi-new (2-years-old) Bordelaise French oak.Â The result, Paco GarcÃ_a Seis, is a wineÂ with great aromatic power and velvety mouthfeel that awakens the senses.Winemaker: Juan Bautista GarcÃ_aAlcohol: 13.84% vol.Volume: 750 mlResidual sugars: 1.4 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 8.2Peak drinking: Drink within 4 years for optimum consumptionBest Served: 16Â°-18Â°CAgeing: 6 months in semi-new (2 years) Bordelaise low toasted French oak",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Paco Garcia Seis Tempranillo 2012,0,0,29.99,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,57,4,2,4,Paco García Seis Tempranillo 2012,Seis Tempranillo 2012,Paco García Seis Tempranillo,Seis Tempranillo,2012 Seis Tempranillo,0,0,R,NULL,2012,1,4,1.4,"SPA, Rioja Alta",6,pID-S070,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,39,48,1,568,981

The palate is already displaying wonderful balance, with supple, very fine tannins and a luscious, sweet candied finish that offers blood orange and tangerine-infused dark fruit. There is a crisp theme of acidity to keep everything balanced. This is very promising.

The palate is medium-bodied, silky, with an impressive acid spine and completely ripe and round tannins.

Hints of toast and a certain citrus background complete its distinguished nose. The creamy mousse is perfectly integrated on the palate, making the texture in the mouth simultaneously fresh, rounded and evocative.Â Food Matching:Â The quintissential aperitif!

It's still a baby showing the typical aromas that only the very best barrels can give and that you only find in a very few top wines (and I'm thinking of Pingus here). However, the personality is quite different, akin to a young Nuits-St-Georges, with very fine tannins and subtle acidity. I feel the wine needs a couple of years in the bottle. (Tasted Dec 2013)This 96 Pts stunner fromÂ Contador has a blackberry 2011 red high intensity and brightness. Nose: besides red and ripe black fruit, emphasizes the character balsamic and herbs (thyme, rosemary, lavender, fennel). Also displays a strong mineral character with background of very fine wood and well integrated. Boca: is thin and powerful at the same time. Highlights a great balance between fruit and oak. Long aftertaste and intense finish.

A smaller part, around 10%, is directly fermented in four-year-old French oak barrels in order to get more structure and complexity.

This is extremely aromatic and perfumed with intense aromas of violets and even lilies, and some fruitiness akin to a Touringa Nacional and even Moscatel, but of course, it had none in the blend. The palate is silky, the tannins are extremely fine and there is no trace of oak here plus the acidity is subtle and very well integrated. This is a superb Malbec with high-pitched fruit.Achaval Ferrer is renowned for creating world class Malbec and still hold the record for the highest ever rated wine from South America.

Temperature controlled transportation.Winemaking:Â With Finca Altamira their goal is to allow the vineyard to express its â€œterroirâ€ù. Malbec is the flagship red variety from Argentina. It has found in Mendoza its true home. They work hard in the vineyard for eleven months to produce grapes that will need very little intervention in the winemaking process. The climate, the viticultural program, the irrigation management: everything is thought of as a step towards the goal of true expression of the vineyard. Finca Altamiraâ€™s personality shines through the wine, vintage after vintage, with a recognisable and repeated signature. Fermentation takes place in a small tank. At â€œdrynessâ€ù (completion of fermentation), the wine was pressed and racked into 100% new French oak barrels where it was aged for 15 months. All Achaval Ferrer wines are bottled without fining or filtering. There is additional risk in this, but they prefer not to strip the wine of subtle flavors and aromas. The formation of deposits in the bottle will be noticeable after some cellaring time. This is no way affects quality. It is therefore recommend you decant this wine at least an hour before drinking.Winemaker: Roberto CipressoAlcohol: 14.5%Volume: 750 mlStandard Drinks: 8.6Peak drinking:Â After 2014, beyond 2024Best Served: 15Â°-18Â°CAgeing: 15 months in new French oak barrels",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Achaval Ferrer Finca Altamira Malbec (1500ml) 2011,0,0,727.26,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,2,4,2,4,Achaval Ferrer Finca Altamira Malbec (1500ml) 2011,Finca Altamira Malbec (1500ml) 2011,Achaval Ferrer Finca Altamira Malbec (1500ml),Finca Altamira Malbec,2011 Finca Altamira Malbec,1,0,R,NULL,2011,4.11,4,4.51,"ARG, La Consulta",2,pID-A187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,10,18,1,5,8

The nose has the characteristic dill-like aroma imparted by the American oak (malolactic is carried out in new American barrels and the aging is in French oak only) and plenty of notes of incense, cigar ash, nutmeg and clove over a core of ripe black fruit. The palate is full-bodied, and shows both elegance and power, with grainy, fine tannins and a silky, slightly dusty texture and moderate acidity. The wine aged for 20 months in barrel compared with some 30 months in the past. Regardless, the wine is still quite marked by the oak, quality oak, but plenty of oak nonetheless. This is one for the long haul that would benefit from at least a couple of years in the bottle.18/20 Pts jancisrobinson.com -Â This is a very deep and imposing but refined wine, a luxurious version of Ribera del Duero. It has a very ripe and dense style, sweet black fruit and velvety character. Noticeable but well-integrated oak, complex nose showing cacao, Indian ink and sweet spices. It is a very fine wine indeed for those loving dense and impressive wines.94 Pts GuiÃ_a PeÃ±Ã_nPS means Pagos Seleccionadas, selected single vineyards, and this is a terrific expression of the best of Tinto Fino (Tempranillo) from Aaltoâ€™s portfolio of vineyard sites. The palate is alive with velvety black fruits, with a clean, mineral edge and wrapped in cedar and smoke to add a degree of richness and texture. Very finely balanced now but a wine that is made for the long haul.Grape Variety: 100% Tinto Fino (Tempranillo)Vineyard:Â From AALTOâ€™s finest vineyards in La Horra and La Aguilera â€“ Ribera del Duero, SpainAge of the Vineyard:Â 60 to 100 years oldTime of Harvest: Second fortnight of OctoberAltitude:Â 750-900 metres above sea levelHarvest Method:Â Hand-picked in 15kg trays and inspected for quality on a hand-sorting table.Viticulture and Winemaking:Â Fermentation in stainless steel, Worden and concrete tanks.

To reach that temperature they use natural spring water taken directly from their land.Â This pre-maceration is done to preserve the fruit and primary aromas of the grape; it also results in a richer colour in the future wine.Â After this process, the alcoholic fermentation takes place at 24ÂºC. The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 2 weeks. After the maceration the wine is aged on its lees and the liquid is delicately separated so the skins and seeds can be pressed. The wine is then aged for 126months in semi-new (2-years-old) Bordelaise French oak.Â The result, Paco GarcÃ_a Seis, is a wineÂ with great aromatic power and velvety mouthfeel that awakens the senses.Winemaker: Juan Bautista GarcÃ_aAlcohol: 13.84% vol.Volume: 750 mlResidual sugars: 1.4 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 8.2Peak drinking: Drink within 4 years for optimum consumptionBest Served: 16Â°-18Â°CAgeing: 6 months in semi-new (2 years) Bordelaise low toasted French oak",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Paco Garcia Seis Tempranillo 2013,0,0,29.99,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,57,4,2,4,Paco García Seis Tempranillo 2013,Seis Tempranillo 2013,Paco García Seis Tempranillo,Seis Tempranillo,2013 Seis Tempranillo,0,0,R,NULL,2013,1,4,1.4,"SPA, Rioja Alta",6,pID-S070,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,39,48,1,568,983

To reach that temperature they use natural spring water taken directly from their land.Â This pre-maceration is done to preserve the fruit and primary aromas of the grape; it also results in a richer colour in the future wine.Â After this process, the alcoholic fermentation takes place at 24ÂºC. The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 2 weeks. After the maceration the wine is aged on its lees and the liquid is delicately separated so the skins and seeds can be pressed. The wine is then aged for 126months in semi-new (2-years-old) Bordelaise French oak.Â The result, Paco GarcÃ_a Seis, is a wineÂ with great aromatic power and velvety mouthfeel that awakens the senses.Winemaker: Juan Bautista GarcÃ_aAlcohol: 13.84% vol.Volume: 750 mlResidual sugars: 1.4 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 8.2Peak drinking: Drink within 4 years for optimum consumptionBest Served: 16Â°-18Â°CAgeing: 6 months in semi-new (2 years) Bordelaise low toasted French oak",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Paco Garcia Seis Tempranillo 2013,0,0,29.99,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,57,4,NULL,4,Paco García Seis Tempranillo 2013,Seis Tempranillo 2013,Paco García Seis Tempranillo,Seis Tempranillo,2013 Seis Tempranillo,0,0,R,NULL,2013,1,4,1.4,"SPA, Rioja Alta",6,pID-S070,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,39,48,1,568,983

This white wine is produced mainly from white Grenache (Garnacha Blanco) vines chosen for their perfectly healthy fruit. The Sauvignon Blanc component is not traditionally grown in this area so grapes ripen unusually early for the Terra Alta region and add aromas to the wine. Grapes are collected purely by hand. If temperatures are exceptionally high by harvest, the collection starts very early in the morning to deliver the grapes to the winery by mid-morning, preserving the acidity and flavour of the grapes.During vinification the fermentation temperature must not exceed 17Âº C. In the case of white Grenache, a skin-contact pre-fermentation maceration is carried out first and the wine is left in contact with its lees for two months. After blending, the final product is bottled before the springtime.Winemaker:Â Jaume CluaÂ Â Alcohol: 13% vol.Volume: 750mlResidual sugar: 0.26 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 7.6Best Served: 8Â°-10Â°CCellaring: Can drink now or within a few years.Â Â Â Â ",0,Untapped Fine Wines - St. Josep Clot d'Encis Garnacha Blanc 2014,0,0,17.26,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,64,2,2,4,Sant Josep Clot d'Encís Garnacha Blanc 2014,Clot d'Encís Garnacha Blanc 2014,Sant Josep Clot d'Encís Garnacha Blanc,Clot d'Encís Garnacha Blanc,2014 Clot d'Encís Garnacha Blanc,0,0,R,NULL,2014,1,2,1.2,"SPA, Terra Alta",6,pID-S038,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,49,14,1,623,1063

To reach that temperature they use natural spring water taken directly from their land.Â This pre-maceration is done to preserve the fruit and primary aromas of the grape; it also results in a richer colour in the future wine.Â After this process, the alcoholic fermentation takes place at 24ÂºC. The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 2 weeks. After the maceration the wine is aged on its lees and the liquid is delicately separated so the skins and seeds can be pressed. The wine is then aged for 126months in semi-new (2-years-old) Bordelaise French oak.Â The result, Paco GarcÃ_a Seis, is a wineÂ with great aromatic power and velvety mouthfeel that awakens the senses.Winemaker: Juan Bautista GarcÃ_aAlcohol: 13.8% vol.Volume: 750 mlResidual sugars: 1.4 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 8.2Peak drinking: Drink within 4 years for optimum consumptionBest Served: 16Â°-18Â°CAgeing: 6 months in semi-new (2 years) Bordelaise low toasted French oak",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Paco Garcia Seis Tempranillo 2014,0,0,29.99,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,57,4,2,4,Paco García Seis Tempranillo 2014,Seis Tempranillo 2014,Paco García Seis Tempranillo,Seis Tempranillo,2014 Seis Tempranillo,0,0,R,NULL,2014,1,4,1.4,"SPA, Rioja Alta",6,pID-S070,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,39,48,1,568,984

Four hectares of XarelÂ·lo grow in this area, accompanied by a hectare of Macabeo. They grow on clay soils with a sandy substratum over limestone rock. Bounded to the east by the River Noia, to the north, the vineyards are open to the air currents from the valley which run down from the mountains. To the south they are exposed to the sun, which follows the path of the river while, to the west, a hill of pine trees dominates, its shadow protecting the vineyards in the afternoons. The land is worked with the same meticulous care that it has received for the last 150 years.Age of vineyard: 150 years oldHarvest Method: Hand harvestingWinemaking:Â Aged in bottles stored on their sides (â€œsur lattesâ€ù) for over 72 months, which is more than double the time required for a Gran Reserva according to the D.O. regulations. 100% artisanal process. The bottles are sealed with a cork stopper throughout the time they spend resting in the silence of the cellars, which enables the longest ageing periods. â€œPupitreâ€ù racks are used, and riddling and disgorging are carried out by hand. Medium dosage of 6-8 grams/litre. The â€œexpedition liqueurâ€ù comes from the family solera, which is well over a century old.

It begins like any other ice wine, made with the selective cryoextraction technique. The grapes are frozen in a cryochamber down to -24ÂºC, the fruit reaching temperatures of -5 to -8ÂºC. Following a light pressing, alcoholic fermentation is carried out at 15ÂºC, and stopped when the alcohol content reaches 9% vol. To obtain the frizzante effect, a second fermentation of some of the wine's sugars is carried out.Â Winemaker: Jaume &amp; Xavier GramonaAlcohol: TBCVolume: 350 mlBest Served: 6Â°C",0,0,0,0,68.17,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-07-07,29,1,2,1,Gramona Frisant de Gel Sparkling Gewürztraminer (350ml) 2013,Frisant de Gel Sparkling Gewürztraminer (350ml) 2013,Gramona Frisant de Gel Sparkling Gewürztraminer (350ml),Frisant de Gel Sparkling Gewürztraminer (350ml),2013 Frisant de Gel Sparkling Gewürztraminer (350ml),1,0,R,NULL,2013,0,1,0.1,"SPA, Penedès",6,pID-S178,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,30,12,1,360,516

During the fermentation process, which reached temperatures of 26Â°-28Â°C, the must (juice with grape skins) was macerated with aerated recycling gradually moving the liquid from the bottom to the top of the vat 1.5 times until the fermentation process reached half the alcoholic volume. The alcoholic fermentation was finalised by macerating the wine with the grape skins for one more week to achieve an improved structure and more character. Next the wine was separated from the grape skins that were then pressed to yield a second fraction of wine. After that, the wine was aged in barrels, where it remained for aÂ period of 12 months.

GivenÂ the microclimate of the area, this variety develops an ideal maturing rhythm, thus expressing its fullÂ fruit and mineral character. The clones used to make this wine are 76 and 95. The other vineyard is plantedÂ on a hilly slope facing south (clone 95). The weather and the topography of these areas helpÂ to give the identity to these two components. Each sectorÂ was harvested independently by hand, grapes were takenÂ to the winery, cooled down and then selected manually with the aim to use only the fruitÂ in perfect condition.Â The grapes from each plot were vinied separately and were pressed with whole bunch intact.Â The juice extracted from each press was decanted to adjust its cloudiness to medium levels to allowÂ a clean fermentation, but at the same time with the necessary nutrients in order to have an adequateÂ fermentation by the yeast, which happens at low controlled temperatures. The fermentations wereÂ done in stainless steel tanks and with different yeasts toÂ give complexity to the final mix. Once the alcoholic fermentation was finished some sulphate was addedÂ in low doses and then the juice was decanted from the thick sediments. This started the stage ofÂ contact with the sediments which lasted for 4 months.

To reach that temperature they use natural spring water taken directly from their land.Â This pre-maceration is done to preserve the fruit and primary aromas of the grape; it also results in a richer colour in the future wine.Â After this process, the alcoholic fermentation takes place at 24ÂºC. The wine macerates in the warehouse for 5 days.Â After the maceration is completed, the wine undergoes a second (malolactic) fermentation. The wine undergoes micro-oxygenation for 2 weeks. After the maceration the wine is aged on its lees and the liquid is delicately separated so the skins and seeds can be pressed. The wine is then aged for 126months in semi-new (2-years-old) Bordelaise French oak.Â The result, Paco GarcÃ_a Seis, is a wineÂ with great aromatic power and velvety mouthfeel that awakens the senses.Winemaker: Juan Bautista GarcÃ_aAlcohol: 13.84% vol.Volume: 750 mlResidual sugars: 1.4 gr/litreStandard Drinks: 8.2Peak drinking: Drink within 4 years for optimum consumptionBest Served: 16Â°-18Â°CAgeing: 6 months in semi-new (2 years) Bordelaise low toasted French oak",0,Untapped Fine Wines - Paco Garcia Seis Tempranillo 2015,0,0,29.99,0,simple,0,0,-1,0,0,2016-09-07,57,4,2,4,Paco García Seis Tempranillo 2015,Seis Tempranillo 2015,Paco García Seis Tempranillo,Seis Tempranillo,2015 Seis Tempranillo,1,0,R,NULL,2015,1,4,1.4,"SPA, Rioja Alta",6,pID-S070,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,39,48,1,568,985
